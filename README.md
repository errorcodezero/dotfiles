# ErrorCode0 Dotfiles
A comfortable set of dotfiles which I use.

# Requirements
1. Linux(Windows will not work, MacOS and BSD might?)

# How to use
1. Install [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/)
2. Open a terminal and run `chezmoi init errorcodezero`
3. Then, run `chezmoi apply -v` and allow it to apply the changes you like and want.
